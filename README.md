# Martin's dotfiles
My dotfiles! I'm tired of constantly having to copy/paste files via USB-drives on new OS installations. This will also help keep all of my stuff updated if I make some changes.

Most of these will be personal notes to myself, as a form of reminder.

# Get started

1. Clone the repo ``git clone https://github.com/martinbjeldbak/dotfiles.git``
2. Run ``dotfiles/bootstrap.sh`` to copy all of these files to home directory
3. Run ``install.sh`` to update system, set [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) and [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) up, install programs listed in ``Brewfile`` and ``Caskfile``, set shell to zsh, install Ruby, set up Neovim and zsh environments with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for vim and [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) for zsh, etcâ€¦
