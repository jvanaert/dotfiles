# Martin's dotfiles
My dotfiles! I'm tired of constantly having to copy/paste files via
USB-drives on new OS installations. This will also help keep all of my
stuff updated if I make some changes.

Most of these will be personal notes to myself, as a form of reminder.

# Get started

Run the install.sh script to set up the most basic things. Note: I'm still working on this. Probably won't know what to add until I need to use these dotfiles on another machine.


## Remember, you already have
They are required for config files .vimrc and .zshrc and should be
loaded automatically due to them being loaded in these files
